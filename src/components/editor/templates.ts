<h2>In Loving Memory of [Name]</h2>
<p>We are gathered here today to celebrate the life of [Name] — a person who touched all of our lives in ways that words can barely capture.</p>
<p>[Name] was many things to many people. To some, [he/she/they] was a [parent/friend/colleague]. To me, [he/she/they] was [describe your relationship and what it meant].</p>
<p>[Share a specific memory or story that captures who they were]</p>
<p>What I will carry with me always is [Name]'s [quality — warmth, laughter, wisdom, generosity]. It was something that lit up every room [he/she/they] walked into.</p>
<p>[Name], you are deeply missed. But the love you gave us doesn't leave — it stays with us, in everything we do.</p>
<p>Thank you for the time we had with you.</p>

<h2>Here's to [Name]</h2>
<p>Good [morning/afternoon/evening] everyone. For those who don't know me, I'm [Your Name], and I've had the privilege of working alongside [Name] for [X years].</p>
<p>After [X] years of [describe role or contribution], [Name] is finally putting down [his/her/their] briefcase — or at least, we hope so.</p>
<p>[Share a story or achievement that captures their professional impact]</p>
<p>But beyond [his/her/their] work, what I'll remember most is [personal quality — dedication, humour, mentorship]. [Name] made our team better not just through [his/her/their] skills, but through who [he/she/they] is as a person.</p>
<p>[Name], you've more than earned this chapter. May it be full of [hobbies, travel, family — whatever fits]. We will miss you every single day.</p>
<p>Please raise a glass — to [Name]!</p>

<h2>To [Name] — My [Best Friend / Brother / Sister]</h2>
<p>Good evening, everyone. For those I haven't met yet, I'm [Your Name], and I've known [Name] for [X years]. Long enough to know all the stories I probably shouldn't tell tonight — but will anyway.</p>
<p>[Open with a light, warm anecdote about the person you're toasting]</p>
<p>When [Name] told me [he/she/they] was getting married, I wasn't surprised. [He/She/They] has always known what [he/she/they] wanted — and [Partner's Name] is everything [he/she/they] deserves.</p>
<p>[Share something genuine about the couple — how they met, what makes them right for each other, a moment you witnessed]</p>
<p>[Partner's Name], thank you for making [Name] so happy. We're so glad you're part of the family now.</p>
<p>Would everyone please raise a glass? To [Name] and [Partner's Name] — may your love be as strong as [Name]'s [insert joke] and your marriage full of joy. Cheers!</p>

<h2>To [Name] and [Name]</h2>
<p>I don't think any of us are surprised to be standing here tonight. If you've ever seen [Name] and [Partner's Name] together, you know that this moment was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>[Share a brief, warm observation about the couple's dynamic or relationship]</p>
<p>An engagement is just the beginning — and what a beginning it is. You've already shown us what a great team looks like.</p>
<p>Please join me in raising a glass to [Name] and [Partner's Name]. May your engagement be joyful, your wedding unforgettable, and your life together everything you've dreamed of. Cheers!</p>

<h2>A Few Words About [Name]</h2>
<p>I was asked to say a few kind words about [Name]. So: "a few kind words." That's it, I'm done.</p>
<p>[Joking aside — open with a light exaggerated roast of something harmless: their habits, personality quirk, or running joke among friends]</p>
<p>But in all seriousness — and I promise I mean this — [Name] is one of the [funniest/most generous/most loyal] people I know. [He/She/They] would do anything for the people [he/she/they] cares about, and that's what makes [him/her/them] so easy to love. And so easy to make fun of.</p>
<p>[Add one more gentle, funny story before wrapping up warmly]</p>
<p>[Name], this one's for you. May your [next year/marriage/next chapter] be everything you deserve — which, given what I just said, is actually quite a lot. Cheers!</p>
